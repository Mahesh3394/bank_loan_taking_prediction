# Problem Statement:
‘Znailla Bank’, a subsidiary within the ‘Znailla Group’, which is a multinational insurance group with a presence in the banking industry, offers a term deposit product.

In the last 2 years, ‘Znailla Bank’ has invested massively in reaching out to its portfolio of existing customers - those with already a current account- to offer the product through a call center campaign. In fact, ‘Znailla Bank’ has been running a process which selects a subset of their customer portfolio every week, and the list of those customers is sent to the call center to be actioned.

The campaign has a positive impact, but given the significant cost of the call (~8€) and Znailla's commitment to process optimization, the management has decided to investigate how to use Analytics to help us to improve the costs-efficiency of the process.

The head of Marketing has asked whether it would be possible to reduce the number of calls by predicting the "wasted calls" (calls to non-converting customers). Specifically, he asks how many calls can be saved, given that he wants to lose as little business as possible.

As the data scientist responsible for this project, your role is to build a Machine Learning pipeline to identify customers that should be called within the weekly cohort and provide recommendations on how to reduce the number of calls.
